- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jmcdivitt
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in using Python and open source GIS/modelling software (e.g., QGIS, GemPy) to analyze geological and financial data from the mining and metals
industry. Through this data analysis, I aim to gain experience in and add value to exploration targeting, resource modelling, and financial analysis.
